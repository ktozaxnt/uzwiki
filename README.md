# Uzbek Wikipedia Automation Bot (Zero-Cost Architect V5.0)

## Technical Standards Achieved

The bot has been upgraded to a "Set and Forget" autonomous machine that leverages free AI models while maintaining professional, bureaucrat-level article quality.

### 1. Zero-Cost Multi-Model Engine
- **OpenRouter Integration:** The bot is now engineered to use OpenRouter's free model tier (e.g., DeepSeek R1, Llama 3.3, Gemma 3).
- **Self-Healing Fallback:** Implemented a multi-model fallback logic. If the primary free model fails or rate-limits, the script automatically cycles through a prioritized list of alternative free models.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Every AI request includes a strict 60-second timeout and exponential backoff retries.

### 2. Infobox Perfection ({{Bilgiquti aholi punkti}})
- **Strict Newline Formatting:** Every parameter is guaranteed to start with `\n|`, ensuring 100% compatibility with MediaWiki's table rendering engine.
- **Dynamic Mapping:** Parameters are dynamically mapped from Wikidata and English Wikipedia, including complex nested templates.

### 3. Advanced AI Trash Sanitizer
- **Aggressive Artifact Removal:** A multi-stage regex pipeline strips all AI-generated "garbage," including thinking tags (`<think>`), triple quotes, Markdown code fences, and preamble chatter.
- **Redundancy Control:** The sanitizer automatically detects and removes redundant infoboxes or meta-templates generated by the AI to ensure the final wikitext is clean and professional.

### 4. Academic Uzbek (SOV Structure)
- **Linguistic Precision:** Hardcoded "Academic Uzbek Architect V5.0" prompt ensures formal tone and Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) sentence structure.
- **Reference Integrity:** `<ref>` tags are preserved and correctly placed after punctuation marks.
